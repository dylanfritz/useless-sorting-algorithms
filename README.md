# useless-sorting-algorithms
Some useless and inefficient sorting algorithms I implemented in Python on a whim. Enjoy :)

I was watching this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktgxMtWMflU) by the creator Ardens when I had the idea to try and write some of these myself. Some serious 2 AM YouTube energy, I know.
