# useless-sorting-algorithms
Some useless and inefficient sorting algorithms I implemented in Python on a whim. Enjoy :)

I was watching this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktgxMtWMflU) by the creator Ardens when I had the idea to try and write some of these myself. Some serious 1 AM YouTube energy, I know.

DISCLAIMER: These examples might not be the best way to implement the algorithms they are meant to replicate. Does it matter? No. These are inefficent by nature. More inefficiency is a bonus in my eyes. (Also it is now almost 2 AM and I can't be bothered with best practice at the moment.)
